Key Concepts and Tasks Overview:
Running JavaScript using Node.js:

Learn to execute JavaScript code directly in the Node.js environment.
Using Node.js Modules:

Understand how to use built-in Node.js modules like fs for file operations and http for creating servers.
Reading Files:

Work with synchronous and asynchronous file operations to read and process data from a CSV file.
Creating HTTP Servers:

Start by creating basic HTTP servers using Node.js's http module and progress to more advanced implementations.
Implement similar functionality using Express.js, which simplifies routing and server management.
Process API and Command Line Arguments:

Learn to access environment variables and command-line arguments using the process object.
Testing and Linting:

Ensure your code passes all the required tests using Jest and follows the linting rules specified in the .eslintrc.js file.
Initial Steps:
Set Up Your Environment:

Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 12.x.x as specified).
Navigate to the project directory and run $ npm install to install all dependencies.
Start with Basic Tasks:

Begin with simple tasks like creating a function that prints a string (0-console.js).
Gradually move on to more complex tasks such as reading from files and handling HTTP requests.
Utilize Resources:

Refer to the provided resources like the Node.js documentation and Express.js guides to get a deeper understanding of each concept.
Testing Your Code:

Regularly run tests using $ npm run test to ensure your implementation meets the requirements.
Use $ npm run full-test to check both linting and testing in one command.
Use Nodemon:

Nodemon can help you by automatically restarting your server whenever you make changes to the code.
